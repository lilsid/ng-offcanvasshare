This is a Angular JS based Stick share buttons which will be located on the left in approximately mid-left.

This is an offcanvas type of share buttons which will enter into the screen when you click the sticky share button on the left.

No need to configure the urls as this one will share the url of that page from which you have pressed the share button.
